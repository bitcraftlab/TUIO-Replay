# TUIO replay

__Replaying Captured Videos and TUIO messages__

- We used [CamTwist](http://camtwiststudio.com/Ë˜) to forward a prerecorded video to reacTIVision  
- The resulting TUIO packages were dumped as pcap using [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)

## Requirements

- Processing 3.3
- TUIO processing library 1.1.5  (included in the code folder)
- [bittwist]( http://bittwist.sourceforge.net/) for replaying network traffic
